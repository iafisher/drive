**Use case**: You use Linux and want to sync your files on Google Drive to your
desktop. You don't like LibreOffice so you primarily use the web app to edit
your documents, but you want to have an offline copy for when you don't have
Internet access.

Many or most of your files are Google Docs, so [grive2](https://github.com/vitalif/grive2)
isn't an option. [Insync](https://www.insynchq.com/downloads) is nice but you
don't want to pay for it. You can't seem to configure the [drive](https://github.com/odeke-em/drive)
or [rclone](https://rclone.org/) CLI clients to do what you want.
