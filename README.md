Use case: You use Linux and want to sync your files on Google Drive to your
desktop. Many or most of your files are Google Docs, so [grive2](https://github.com/vitalif/grive2)
isn't an option. [Insync](https://www.insynchq.com/downloads) is nice but you
don't want to pay for it. You can't seem to configure the [drive](https://github.com/odeke-em/drive)
or [rclone](https://rclone.org/) CLI clients to do what you want.
